            <p> Java full-stack developer typically learns a combination of technologies and frameworks to handle both front-end and back-end development. Below are some of the key areas and technologies a Java full-stack developer might focus on:

                <br><strong>Core Java:</strong> Strong understanding of the Java programming language, its features, syntax, and object-oriented principles.
                
                <br><strong>Front-end technologies:</strong> Learning front-end development is crucial for creating user interfaces. A Java full-stack developer might learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
                
                <br><strong>Back-end technologies:</strong> For server-side development, Java developers often learn Java EE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition) or Spring Framework. These frameworks provide tools and libraries to build robust, scalable, and secure server-side applications.
                
                <br><strong>Web Services:</strong> Knowledge of creating and consuming web services is essential for communication between the front-end and back-end systems. RESTful APIs (using JAX-RS) and SOAP-based web services are commonly used in Java full-stack development.
                
                <br><strong>Databases:</strong> Understanding of databases and their interaction with Java applications is important. Commonly used databases in Java development include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MongoDB.
                
                <br><strong>Version Control:</strong> Learning version control systems like Git is essential for collaboration and managing code changes.
                
                <br><strong>Application Servers:</strong> Knowledge of deploying Java applications on application servers like Apache Tomcat, WildFly (formerly JBoss), or GlassFish is often required.
                
                <br><strong>Build and Dependency Management:</strong> Familiarity with build tools like Apache Maven or Gradle, and dependency management concepts to handle external libraries.
                
                <br><strong>Testing:</strong> Learning various testing frameworks like JUnit for unit testing and tools for integration testing and end-to-end testing.
                
                <br><strong>Security:</strong> Awareness of common security practices and techniques to ensure application security, like handling authentication, authorization, and data protection.
                
                <br><strong>DevOps:</strong> Familiarity with DevOps principles and tools for continuous integration, continuous deployment, and automated testing.
                
                <br><strong>Cloud Platforms:</strong> Knowledge of cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for deploying and scaling applications.</p>
